# First-Repository

#this is my first real attempt at learning to code, i have been involved in IT in a technical capacity for 19 years, but i recently became interested in programming. I decided to cut my teeth with C#, but i'll probably explore other languages like Java and c++ once i've become proficient in programming in C#.
